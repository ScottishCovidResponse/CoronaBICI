# CoronaBICI Developer Guide

- Please set your editor to use hard tabs of width 2
- Please develop features and fixes on branches and submit pull
  requests for them to be merged into master
  - In future, we probably will use the master branch only for
    semantically-versioned releases, and features will be merged into
    a develop branch.
- Please make sure that there are no unintended changes to the results
  when making cleanup or optimisation changes, but diffing the output
  with that produced by the master branch.
  - In future, we will have a regression test system to do this
    automatically.
- TODO: decide on contributor agreement/licence etc
